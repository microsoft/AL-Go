# AL-Go Agents

AL-Go for GitHub now offers a set of **sample agents** that you can leverage in your own repositories to get even more out of AL-Go for GitHub.

## How do I use them?

Simply:

1. Create a folder called `.github/agents`
1. Copy the agents contained in this folder into your repository.

⚠️ **Important:** These agents are provided as samples **only**. Please review the instructions and properly test them before copying them into your own codebase.
